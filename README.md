# License
[The original repository](https://github.com/hoge-fuga-0000/Nuts) is not archived at all, so the license is unknown.
But since [hakatashi/esolang-box](https://github.com/hakatashi/esolang-box/tree/master) is licensed under the MIT License and
the Nuts are taken up with attribution, hoge-fuga-0000/Nuts is likely to be used to be published under the MIT License or similar.
